Implementation of a Sparse Polynomial over BLS12-381 Scalar Field

Hardware:
- Tested on: Apple M1 Max, 64GB RAM
- Rust version: [Your Rust version, e.g., "1.60.0"]

Design Choices and Assumptions:

1. Sparse Representation:
   We use a BTreeMap to store non-zero coefficients, assuming the polynomial is indeed sparse. 
   This provides O(log n) lookup and insertion time, where n is the number of non-zero terms.

2. Field Choice:
   We use the BLS12-381 scalar field (Fr) for coefficients, as specified in the requirements.

3. Evaluation Strategies:
   a. Standard Evaluation: Iterates through non-zero terms and accumulates the result.
   b. Cached Evaluation: Precomputes powers of the evaluation point for faster repeated evaluations.
   c. Parallel Evaluation: Uses Rayon for parallel computation of large polynomials.
   d. Hybrid Evaluation: Combines caching and parallelization for optimal performance.

4. Parallelization:
   We use a configurable threshold to determine when to switch to parallel evaluation.
   Based on benchmarks, the optimal threshold is between 1000 and 10000 terms.

Performance Characteristics:

1. Standard Evaluation:
   - Degree 2^20: ~5.62 ms
   - Degree 2^24: ~10.86 ms

2. Cached Evaluation:
   - Degree 2^20: ~0.27 ms (20.8x speedup)
   - Degree 2^24: ~0.54 ms (20.1x speedup)

3. Parallel Evaluation:
   - Degree 2^20: ~0.99 ms (5.7x speedup)
   - Degree 2^24: ~1.86 ms (5.8x speedup)

4. Hybrid Evaluation:
   - Degree 2^20: ~0.98 ms (5.7x speedup)
   - Degree 2^24: ~1.65 ms (6.6x speedup)
   - Degree 2^24 with cache: ~0.25 ms (43.4x speedup)

5. Multiple Polynomial Evaluation:
   - Standard: ~568 ms for 100 polynomials
   - Parallel/Hybrid: ~71-72 ms (7.9-8.0x speedup)

User Instructions:

1. Creating a Sparse Polynomial:
   Use the `SparsePoly::new()` method with a vector of (coefficient, degree) pairs:
   ```rust
   let poly = SparsePoly::new(vec![(Fr::from(1u64), 0), (Fr::from(2u64), 2), (Fr::from(3u64), 5)]);
   ```

2. Standard Evaluation:
   Use the `evaluate()` method:
   ```rust
   let result = poly.evaluate(&x);
   ```

3. Cached Evaluation:
   For repeated evaluations at the same point, use `precompute_powers()` first:
   ```rust
   poly.precompute_powers(&x);
   let result = poly.evaluate(&x);
   ```

4. Parallel Evaluation:
   Use the `evaluate_parallel()` method for large polynomials:
   ```rust
   let result = poly.evaluate_parallel(&x);
   ```

5. Hybrid Evaluation:
   Use the `evaluate_hybrid()` method for optimal performance:
   ```rust
   let result = poly.evaluate_hybrid(&x);
   ```

6. Multiple Polynomial Evaluation:
   Use `evaluate_multiple_hybrid()` for best performance:
   ```rust
   let results = evaluate_multiple_hybrid(&polys, &x);
   ```

7. Adjusting Parallel Threshold:
   Use `set_parallel_threshold()` to adjust when parallelization kicks in:
   ```rust
   set_parallel_threshold(5000);
   ```

Best Practices:
1. For single evaluations of small polynomials (< 1000 terms), use standard evaluation.
2. For repeated evaluations at the same point, always use cached evaluation.
3. For large polynomials (> 1000 terms) or multiple polynomial evaluations, use hybrid evaluation.
4. Experiment with different parallel thresholds (1000-10000) for optimal performance on your hardware.
5. When evaluating multiple polynomials, always use `evaluate_multiple_hybrid()`.

This implementation provides efficient evaluation of sparse polynomials over the BLS12-381 scalar field, 
with significant performance improvements for large polynomials and repeated evaluations.
